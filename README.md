# Predicting-Factory-Machine-Status-ML-Project
This project builds and trains a machine learning model to predict the operational status of factory machines. Using process data such as ambient temperature, process temperature, rotation speed, and tool wear, the model classifies whether a machine is operating normally or at risk of failure.
